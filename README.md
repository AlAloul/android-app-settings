# android-app-settings
An Android module for Titanium. Cleanly opens the OS's settings page for the app.

Usage:
```
require("com.restadoapp.androidappsettings").go_to_app_settings();
```

Simple as that. Taking them there seems to be the closest we can get to the actual app permissions page, which is one click away from the settings page.
